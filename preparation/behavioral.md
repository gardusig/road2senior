# Summary

- Don't be very technical
- Try using STAR method whenever possible

## STAR method

The STAR method is a structured way of answering behavioral interview questions. It stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result.

- **Situation**: Describe the context of the situation. This could be a work-related situation, a volunteer experience, or even a personal situation. Be sure to provide enough detail so that the interviewer can understand the situation.
- **Task**: What was your specific goal or responsibility in this situation?
- **Action**: What steps did you take to achieve your goal? Be as specific as possible and highlight the skills and abilities you used.
- **Result**: What was the outcome of your actions? Did you achieve your goal? If so, how? If not, what did you learn from the experience?

### Why have I left Amazon?

- 🤯 💰 Remote offer compensation:
  - Changed currency, from `BRL` to `USD`:
    - Increased my `gross income` by at least 50%
  - Changed job type, from standard employee to contractor:
    - Increased my `net income` by at least 100%, due to less taxes
- 😑 🏝 Constant push back around `return to office`:
  - Office city was in my hometown, not that exciting
  - Freedom to live anywhere, while:
    - Earning more
    - Spending less
- 😴 😎 `Amazon.com.br` projects weren't that interesting, basically adding more layers to existing services in order to be compliant with Brazilian laws
  - New job projects were much more interesting at the moment, startup feeling
- 😩 😠 Worked basically on `tech debt` since day 1
  - Improved resilience score of a service that was transferred to another team right after that
  - Next tasks were very similar, doing the same stuff for a new service 😒
- 🤩 🤔 New company was small and was totally unique for my career
  - Liked the founders and saw a great learning opportunity
  - I had to solve many distinct problems in a short period of time that made me much quicker
