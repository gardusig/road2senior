# Summary

- Don't be very technical
- Try using STAR method whenever possible

## STAR method

The STAR method is a structured way of answering behavioral interview questions. It stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result.

- **Situation**: Describe the context of the situation. This could be a work-related situation, a volunteer experience, or even a personal situation. Be sure to provide enough detail so that the interviewer can understand the situation.
- **Task**: What was your specific goal or responsibility in this situation?
- **Action**: What steps did you take to achieve your goal? Be as specific as possible and highlight the skills and abilities you used.
- **Result**: What was the outcome of your actions? Did you achieve your goal? If so, how? If not, what did you learn from the experience?

## Stories

### Why have I left Orkes?

I was initially happy with the remote contract at the startup. The compensation was much higher than I would have received as a full-time employee in Brazil, and I had the freedom to work from anywhere. However, I soon realized that the company culture was not a good fit for me. They were looking for people who would follow a command-and-control management style, and I am more of a creative thinker who likes to challenge the status quo. This led to many disagreements, and eventually I felt like I was not able to give my full attention to my side business while working at a startup and lost touch with some messages. As a result, the company decided to end the contract after a year and a half.

The company culture changed after the first year. It became more stressful and demanding, and the management team was less supportive. I felt like I was no longer being heard or valued. I also saw how the team was being treated, and I didn't want to be a part of that.

I was disappointed that the management team stopped appearing and recommended to avoid code reviews. I felt like they didn't care about the team or the work we were doing. This made me feel like I was on my own, and it made it difficult to get the support I needed.

I am still proud of the work I did at the startup. I contributed to many open source projects, and I believe that my work has had a positive impact on the community. I learned that it's important to be clear about my expectations and to find a company culture that is a good fit for me.

After the contract ended, I took some vacation after a long time without one. I also made a good deal selling my company, which allowed me to be free to study and get back on the programming track again.

### Why have I left Amazon?

I joined Amazon as a software engineer on the amazon.com.br fba team. I was excited about the opportunity to work for a large and innovative company, but I quickly realized that the role was not a good fit for me.

The projects I was working on were not very challenging or interesting. I was basically adding more layers to existing services in order to be compliant with Brazilian laws. I also felt like I was constantly working on tech debt. I improved the resilience score of a service, but it was then transferred to another team and I was given a new task that was very similar.

In addition, I was not happy with the compensation and benefits. As a Brazilian employee, I was paid in BRL and had to pay high taxes. When I was offered a remote position at a startup in Silicon Valley, I jumped at the chance.

The new position paid me in USD and I had much lower taxes. I was also able to work remotely, which gave me the freedom to live anywhere I wanted. I was much happier with the projects I got to work on and felt like I made a real impact.

I am excited about the future and I am confident that I made the right decision to leave Amazon.
