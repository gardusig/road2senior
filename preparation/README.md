1. [Behavioral-interview](#behavioral-interview)


## Coding interview

This interview generally takes up to an hour, and you are generally expected to solve a few problem(s) using algorithms and data structures.

Few guides:
- Iterate through some examples to check if you understood the problem and try to find corner cases ASAP
- Ask clarifying questions
- Be honest if you already saw the question before
- Think about distinct solutions and their trade-offs, using time and space complexity to compare them
- Write good quality code, easily readable and efficient, not something that just works
- Test the code by running it against small input/output scenarios and explain what happens at each step. Actually creating each variable and explaining their value changes over execution is just fine.

## Behavioral interview

This interview generally takes up to an hour, and you are generally expected to cover a few of your past experiences. The key point is not to feel ashamed of mistakes, they are quite useful when you have learned a lesson. As you make more distinct mistakes, the better you tend to become.

Few guides:
- Don't be very technical
- Add STAR method explanation link
