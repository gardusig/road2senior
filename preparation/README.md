This interview generally takes up to an hour, and you are generally expected to solve a few problem(s) using algorithms and data structures.

Few guides:
- Iterate through some examples to check if you understood the problem and try to fin corner cases
- Ask clarifying questions
- Be honest if already saw question before
- Think about distinct solutions and their trade-offs, using time and space complexity to compare them
- Write good quality code, easily readable and efficient, not something that just works
- Test the code by running it against small input/output scenarios and explain each variable value
