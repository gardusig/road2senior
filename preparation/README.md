  - Be enthusiastic about the opportunity
- Dress appropriately
- Be on time for the interview

  - The interviewer might ask you a question that you have never seen before
    - Be prepared to think on your feet and to come up with a solution
- Got stuck? Don't be afraid to ask for help

## Coding interview

This interview generally takes up to an hour, and you are generally expected to solve a few problem(s) using algorithms and data structures.

I think the best result comes from the ease of understanding an interviewer has on why a code exists and how it works. It should look like a reasonable solution and easy to read. You can achieve it by communicating your thought process to the interviewer. Check out more details [here](./coding.md).

### Practice

I recommend using LeetCode, but smartly (by filtering which questions and not randomly solving them):

- https://neetcode.io/practice
- https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions

## Behavioral interview

This interview generally takes up to an hour, and you are generally expected to cover a few of your past experiences.

The interviewer is looking forward to understanding your thought process on decision making under a few situations. The key point is to not feel ashamed of mistakes, they are quite useful when you have learned a lesson. As you make more distinct mistakes, the better you tend to become. Check out more details [here](./behavioral.md).

## System design interview

This interview generally takes up to an hour, and you are generally expected to draw a few things that can be read as a computer system. It does not have to be perfect, otherwise you would be eligible to replace a bunch of people :) Check out more details [here](./sysdesign.md).

## Ask at the end

By the end of each interview, you are expected to have around 5 minutes to ask a few questions to the interviewer. It's an opportunity to clarify if you actually like the company and maybe show interest through an unexpected curiosity. [here](./followup.md).

## After the interview

Send a thank-you note to the interviewer. I personally think it's as useful as a cover letter.
