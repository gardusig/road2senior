## Coding Interview

🎯 Focus on *curated* lists — **don’t** waste time grinding random problems.

**To succeed**: solve the problem *and* clearly communicate your thinking.

### Clarify Early

- 🤔 Ask questions to fully understand the problem.
- 🔍 Use examples to clarify and test understanding.
- 🙋 Be honest if you’ve seen the problem before.
- ⚠️ Think about edge cases *from the beginning*.

### Analyze Inputs & Outputs

- 📏 Understand size, range, and limits of inputs.
- ⏱️ Estimate **time** and **space complexity**.
- 🧩 Look for clues in data structure sizes and patterns.

### Evaluate Approaches

- 🪜 Start with a brute-force baseline.
- 🛠️ Look for repeated work.
- ⚖️ Weigh trade-offs: *efficiency* vs *simplicity*.

### Write Clean Code

- 🏷️ Use **descriptive** variable and function names.
- 🧱 Keep logic *modular* and focused.
- 🧹 Maintain consistent indentation and whitespace.

### Test Thoroughly

- 🧪 Try diverse inputs: small, large, and corner cases.
- 🐛 Manually walk through code for tricky scenarios.
- 🧠 Explain your logic at each step like you're teaching someone.

## Behavioral Interview

**The goal is to reveal how you *think*, *decide*, and *grow*.**

Don’t shy away from failure stories — what matters is how you *responded* and what you *learned* Think of each story as a “case study” in how you operate under pressure, ambiguity, or conflict.

### STAR Method

Structure your stories using the ⭐ **STAR** method to keep them clear and compelling.

#### Situation
- **Set the stage**: Briefly describe the context — where you were, who was involved, and why it mattered.
- *Assume the interviewer has no context* — skip acronyms and jargon.

#### Task
- **Define the challenge**: What was your specific goal or responsibility?
- Clarify what was expected of *you* specifically.

#### Action
- **Explain what you did**: Walk through your thought process and steps taken.
- Emphasize ownership, problem-solving, and leadership moments.

#### Result
- **Show the outcome**: Use metrics, impact, or feedback to back it up.
- *Reflect*: What did you learn? What changed as a result?

### Story Creation Guidance

1. **Craft Engaging Titles**
   - Use data, outcomes, or context:  
     _“Scaling a System for 10x Black Friday Traffic”_ > _“Worked on scalability”_

2. **Keep a Consistent Narrative**
   - Stories should form a *cohesive picture* of your experience, values, and growth.

3. **End on a Constructive Note**
   - Even failures should close with a lesson, change, or improvement.

## System Design Interview

**You're not expected to be perfect — you're expected to think aloud, make trade-offs, and justify your choices.**

> Prioritize *clarity*, *scalability*, and *reasoned decisions* over technical depth alone.

## Ask at the End

Use the last ~5 minutes to ask meaningful questions that show curiosity and help you evaluate the team/company.

> Great questions show you're thoughtful, invested, and interviewing *them* too.
