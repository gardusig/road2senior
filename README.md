## Coding Interview

This round typically lasts up to an hour and involves solving one or more problems using algorithms and data structures.

To perform well, focus on clearly communicating your thought process. Your code should be clean, readable, and reflect a thoughtful approach — the interviewer should be able to follow not just what you wrote, but why.

## Behavioral Interview

The interviewer is trying to understand how you make decisions in different situations. Don’t shy away from sharing mistakes — what matters is what you learned from them. The more unique your experiences, the more compelling your answers.

### STAR Method

Structure your stories using the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) framework to keep them clear, concise, and compelling.

#### Situation
- **Set the Stage**: Briefly describe the context — where you were, who was involved, and what made the situation important or challenging.
- **Keep It Understandable**: Assume the interviewer has no context — avoid internal acronyms or obscure domain terms.

#### Task
- **Define the Challenge**: Explain your specific responsibility or goal in that scenario.
- **Clarify Expectations**: Make your role and objectives clear so your contributions are easy to understand.

#### Action
- **Describe What You Did**: Walk through your thought process and the steps you took. Emphasize relevant skills, strategies, and decisions.
- **Highlight Ownership and Initiative**: Show how you led, solved problems, or went beyond the basic requirements.

#### Result
- **Show the Outcome**: Quantify the results if possible — e.g., time saved, revenue generated, performance improved.
- **Reflect on Growth**: Whether the outcome was a success or a learning moment, explain what you took away and how it shaped your future actions.

### Story Creation Guidance

1. **Craft Engaging Titles**
   - Include data, dates, or metrics to strengthen your credibility. Keep your stories focused and impactful. Think of your story title like a headline that sparks curiosity (e.g., *“Scaling a System for 10x Black Friday Traffic”*). 

2. **Keep a Consistent Narrative**
   - Your stories should reinforce each other. They should build a coherent picture of your values, growth, and professional journey — like puzzle pieces forming a bigger image.

3. **End on a Constructive Note**
   - Even if the outcome wasn’t perfect, conclude with a positive takeaway: a win, a lesson, or how it made you better. Think of it like the moral at the end of a classic cartoon (e.g., *He-Man*).

## System Design Interview

This round involves sketching out the design of a computer system. It doesn’t need to be perfect — you’re not expected to replace an entire engineering team. The goal is to demonstrate how you think through trade-offs and make decisions.

## Ask at the End

You'll usually have ~5 minutes to ask the interviewer any question. Use this as a chance to show genuine interest and figure out if the company is a good fit for you.
