## Coding Interview

This round typically lasts up to an hour and involves solving one or more problems using algorithms and data structures.

To perform well, focus on clearly communicating your thought process. Your code should be clean, readable, and reflect a thoughtful approach — the interviewer should be able to follow not just what you wrote, but why.

## Behavioral Interview

This session usually takes around an hour and focuses on discussing your past experiences.

The interviewer is trying to understand how you make decisions in different situations. Don’t shy away from sharing mistakes — what matters is what you learned from them. The more unique your experiences, the more compelling your answers.

## System Design Interview

This round also lasts about an hour and involves sketching out the design of a computer system.

It doesn’t need to be perfect — you’re not expected to replace an entire engineering team. The goal is to demonstrate how you think through trade-offs and system-level decisions.

## Ask at the End

At the end of each interview, you'll usually have ~5 minutes to ask the interviewer questions.

Use this as a chance to show genuine interest and figure out if the company is a good fit for you. Asking insightful or unexpected questions can leave a strong impression.
