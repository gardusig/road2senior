## Coding Interview

This interview generally takes up to an hour, and you are expected to solve one or more problems using algorithms and data structures.

To achieve the best results, aim to communicate your thought process clearly. Your code should represent a reasonable solution and be easy to read, allowing the interviewer to understand why each part of your solution exists and how it works. [Check out more details here](./preparation/coding.md).

## Behavioral Interview

This interview generally takes up to an hour, and you are expected to cover a few of your past experiences.

The interviewer wants to understand your thought process in decision-making under different situations. The key is not to feel ashamed of mistakes; they are quite useful when you have learned a lesson. The more distinct mistakes you make, the better you tend to become. [Check out more details here](./preparation/behavioral.md).

## System Design Interview

This interview generally takes up to an hour, and you are expected to draw a few things that can be interpreted as a computer system. It does not have to be perfect; otherwise, you would be eligible to replace a bunch of people. [Check out more details here](./preparation/system-design.md).

## Ask at the End

By the end of each interview, you are expected to have around 5 minutes to ask a few questions to the interviewer. It's an opportunity to clarify if you actually like the company and to show interest through an unexpected curiosity. [Check out more details here](./preparation/ask-at-the-end.md).
