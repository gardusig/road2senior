## Coding Interview

üéØ Focus on *curated* lists ‚Äî **don‚Äôt** waste time grinding random problems.

**To succeed**: solve the problem *and* clearly communicate your thinking.

### Clarify Early

- ü§î Ask questions to fully understand the problem.
- üîç Use examples to clarify and test understanding.
- üôã Be honest if you‚Äôve seen the problem before.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Think about edge cases *from the beginning*.

### Analyze Inputs & Outputs

- üìè Understand size, range, and limits of inputs.
- ‚è±Ô∏è Estimate **time** and **space complexity**.
- üß© Look for clues in data structure sizes and patterns.

### Evaluate Approaches

- ü™ú Start with a brute-force baseline.
- üõ†Ô∏è Look for repeated work.
- ‚öñÔ∏è Weigh trade-offs: *efficiency* vs *simplicity*.

### Write Clean Code

- üè∑Ô∏è Use **descriptive** variable and function names.
- üß± Keep logic *modular* and focused.
- üßπ Maintain consistent indentation and whitespace.

### Test Thoroughly

- üß™ Try diverse inputs: small, large, and corner cases.
- üêõ Manually walk through code for tricky scenarios.
- üß† Explain your logic at each step like you're teaching someone.

## Behavioral Interview

**The goal is to reveal how you *think*, *decide*, and *grow*.**

Don‚Äôt shy away from failure stories ‚Äî what matters is how you *responded* and what you *learned*.

### STAR Method

Structure your stories using the ‚≠ê **STAR** method to keep them clear and compelling.

#### Situation
- Briefly describe the context ‚Äî where you were, who was involved, and why it mattered.
- *Assume the interviewer has no context* ‚Äî skip acronyms and jargon.

#### Task
- What was your specific goal or responsibility?
- Clarify what was expected of *you* specifically.

#### Action
- Walk through your thought process and steps taken.
- Emphasize ownership, problem-solving, and leadership moments.

#### Result
- Show the outcome - use metrics, impact, or feedback to back it up.
- What did you learn? What changed as a result?

### Story Creation Guidance

1. **Craft Engaging Titles**
   - _‚ÄúScaling a System for 10x Black Friday Traffic‚Äù_ > _‚ÄúWorked on scalability‚Äù_

2. **Keep a Consistent Narrative**
   - Stories should form a *cohesive picture* of your experience, values, and growth.

3. **End on a Constructive Note**
   - Even failures should close with a lesson, change, or improvement.

## System Design Interview

- Think aloud, make trade-offs, and justify your choices.
- Prioritize *clarity*, *scalability*, and *reasoned decisions* over personal preference.

## Ask at the End

Use the last ~5 minutes to ask meaningful questions that show curiosity and help you evaluate the team/company.
